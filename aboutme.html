            more than 6 Years. Furthermore, I am adept at handling multiple tasks on a daily basis<br>
            competently and at working well under pressure. Moreover, I have also cleared Skill<br>
            Assesements:Level1 and Level2 in AML from NatWest Group. I have recently enrolled<br>
            myself into the "Software-Engineer Re-skilling Programme". Working in Operations<br>
            and now opting for this opportunity had not been the easy decision. However, the<br>
